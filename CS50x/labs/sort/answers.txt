sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I know, because of its speed best case it is faster than sort3 but slower than sort2, so its omega must be n and so it is Bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I know, because it has the fastest speed best case. So it's omega must be n log n, the big O of merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: I know, because it took the longest time best case. So the omega must be n squared, and that is the omega of selection sort.
